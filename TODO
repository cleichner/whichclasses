Notes:
* Need to settle on how to do storage/indexing soon.
* Requirements:
** Primary source of truth is HTML files on disk. Parsed format should be
   regenerated on the fly at server start time.
** Ideally does indexing/searching. Don't want to reimplement.
** Data is highly relational. Relational DB is best.

* Need to parse TceClass page contents into meaningful data, including:
** Normalization of different questions
** Normalization of different answer ranges, thanks to 2011-12
